Marketing a home today requires a balance of creativity, determination to achieve the clients wishes as well as the selling skills required to successfully complete the sale process. Michael Rea has many attributes which I believe make him stand out from the crowd when it comes to entrusting your home with an Agent to sell. Michael is always upfront and honest in his assessments and has the ability to deliver what he promises. It is a fact that in today’s world some people promise the earth to gain your business but then simply don’t deliver however I absolutely guarantee that this will not be the case with Michael and there are past client references that confirm this.

Michael puts a massive effort into ensuring any home he is selling has first class marketing to attract a premium sale price . His attention to detail when it comes to creating advertising for your home is one of the many skills he utilises to attract the right buyers for your home. Once he has attracted potential buyers he has the necessary skills to guide them through the sale process which for first home buyers in particular is daunting.

Michael is of the generation that utilises technology to ensure your property reaches the target audience whether it be in Marlborough , NZ or overseas. Younger buyers in particular demand facts and information in a format that suits them so Michaels skills in this are very important.

As a volunteer Fire Fighter in Blenheim Michael has made a strong commitment to Marlburians and to the wider community being on call to assist others in their time of need. Whether you need your home sold or saved Michael is a great choice!
