    From the time we first met Michael, we found him (firstly) to be friendly and upbeat. Someone we could relate well too and feel comfortable with. This, for us, was paramount in our search for our new home. When what we were looking for was not on the market, Michael set to work advertising on our behalf. This resulted in a new adventure for us. Something we are very excited about. Throughout our real estate journey, Michael has remained professional reliable and respectful. Nothing has ever been a problem to him which has made our real estate experience the best we could have wished for. We thank you Michael and are now very happy to call you our friend and future agent.
